## ALL ABOUT CHIF - HOW, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN

#### What is a CHIF FIle Format? Is it a Platform? A Web App?

CHIF stands for C-Hear Intelligent Format. It’s a secure media container or a file format that can hold audio, video, text, metadata and tags. You may not be familiar with the term “media container” but you use media containers all the time. Every time you play an MP3 file or watch a DVD or a Blu-ray, you’re using a “media container”. But CHIF is a new kind of media container that uses intelligent design to offer:

Pictures that “talk” (with embedded human voice, sound effects and/or sound marks.

User control of data playback (expiration dates, domain fencing and remote kill switch)

Cloud control

User-specified end to end encryption and security

Easy control and indexing of metadata

A modern format with advanced API features and data structure support.

#### What makes a CHIF File secure and how does it protect my data?

#### What is encoded in a CHIF file?

From our web site: “audio, images, text, video and more”

#### How do I manage my security and meta-data features?

CHIFs are immutable. What is meant by “manage”? If something in a CHIF needs to be changed, it would need to be decoded and rebuilt with new information, most likely creating a new unique identifier in the process.

#### How does the Decoder work and why would I use it?

The browser decoder is freely available for playing CHIF content hosted on web sites.

#### Do I need a special software or player so I can use a CHIF File?

Only a web browser is needed.

#### How will my customers know that it is a CHIF file?

The CHIF logo will be displayed with a download icon overlay if a preview image exists on a CHIF. This is similar in appearance as an embedded YouTube player on a web page.

#### Where do I find a developers kit, samples, and how to videos on using the platform?

https://github.com/C-Hear - Connect to preview

#### How much will this cost me on a monthly basis and what do I get?

The CHIF launch product starting in August, 2020 will be three tiers as well as a customizable Enterprise solution that a customer service representative can assist you with. We provide a FREE version that offers the bare minimal requirements for building and storing 15 CHIFs. The Bronze version is available for about $200 per year ($19.98) a month and is meant for websites with approximately 2,000 or fewer visitors per month. Furthermore, you :

Switch to Disable (Kill) a CHIF, or re-Enable a CHIF

Single Organizational Member Account (owner’s account)

Limited to 80 CHIFs in the CHIF Manager Library

Custom Data assigned using Key-Value Pairs\*

CHIF Analytics & Reporting

CHIF Search by All (or filtered) Data inside CHIF Manager

99% Guaranteed Up-time (SLA)

#### What happens if I no longer want the service and cancel mid-month?

You can cancel at anytime and you will not be charged for the next month but we cannot prorate your monthly usage.

#### How do I know what subscription I am on?

Your subscription plan is located at the top of each page section.

#### What happens if I reach my CHIF limitations?

We are happy to help you upgrade your subscription plan. Plus when you upgrade you have more digital rights. Download and save or delete them and start building more!

#### Can I change the audio setting to play louder or softer?

This is controlled by the device, not the CHIF

#### Can I change or increase the font or size of the text anywhere, including in the alt text or .txt file?

Font sizes can be changed using custom CSS.

#### What happens when I kill a file? What will it say on my website? What if I don’t want it to say anything and just go away?

The kill switch prevents the player from decoding a CHIF and playing it in the browser. It doesn’t have access to the file.

#### What if I lose my login and password?

Use the forgot username/password options on the sign in page.

#### What happens if a team member loses their login or password?

Same as above

#### How does tags work?

Tags are currently an organization tool such as labels in Gmail. These could be used by the Manager in the future for locating all CHIFs with a specific tag, but would require an external search index (in development.) Another potential future use of tags would be to display them in the browser player.

#### Does everyone in my organization get to see everything? How about if we want a few CHIF’s that are private?

Enhancement request for the manager.

#### How does meta-data work?

Metadata is internally-facing data for C-Hear to manage CHIFs. It contains information such as UUID and the datestamp when the CHIF was created.

#### How does the start and end dates feature work?

The browser player reads the start and end date and will use the clock on the client to block playing the CHIF if the date is not within the allowed range.

#### What happens if I don’t add a domain name in at all?

The CHIF can be viewed on all web sites.

#### What if I added my Wordpress or HTML5 site as the domain and it doesn’t work, how can I problem solve?

Check the browser’s developer console for error message. A popular issue will be a domain mismatch between the url of the CHIF and the url of the web site. If this happens, the CHIF should be hosted on the same domain as the web site, or the source service hosting the CHIF should enable CORS for the web site domain.

#### How do I communicate sign-up and education to the rest of my organization?

Simply add them to your team with their email and they will get an invite.

#### Can I translate into other languages? Does it work with those types of translation apps?

We are exploring the use of translations applications. If this is a need you have please email info@c-hear.com or reach out to an individual from our website who can help you.

#### How long will it take to covert a large website? Will the builder remember my last settings for the CHIF sizes?

CHIF’s images are the same as whatever you placed into the manager. If you need or want all your images to be a certain size, make sure those are sized before you start making CHIF’s. Once you get everything set and in motion it won’t take long to convert your site.

#### How will my users know to engage with a CHIF?

Once you give them a login they can go in an explore. There isn’t a file highlight at this time.

#### How will my users engage with the CHIF?

When they roll over the image they will see a greyed out frame with a logo and an arround pointing to the player. Once they click that the player is activated and you can start playing the audio and reading the transcript.

#### How will my users be notified that I added a CHIF?

It will live on your page there is no way to notify anyone specifically. If you want to make an announcement we suggest traditional email campaigns.

#### What if my level of tech experience isn’t enough?

Delegate to a website developer or call us at support@c-hear.com and we can see if we can help you.

#### Can I have multiple domain names listed?

Yes, list them one right after the next.

#### Can I have multiple images listed?

At this time, only 1 image is currently supported in the encoder. We are working to allow more than one image. We will let everyone know as soon as the ability to add more images to the CHIF is available. If you license the API a developer in your organization can add this.

#### Can I insert video?

We’ve built a prototype of inserting a video in a CHIF, but it’s incomplete from a styling perspective and not our primary use case since it uses a lot of bandwidth. Please reach out to us at info@c-hear.com if this is an immediate need for your organization.

#### What does the light/dark mode do?

Toggles the theme of the manager based on user preferences between light and dark.

#### How do I change my organizational details?

Simply go to edit details to change your information.

#### How do I remove a member?

Under teams and members you can simply delete users in your organization.

#### Is there a file size limit for the photos or audio?

No, but the goal are to make the files as small as possible before encoding in order to not degrade the loading performance for users with slower internet connections.

#### What does the QUEUE do?

The queue displays a list of requested CHIFs to build. It’s an internal processing list and it doesn’t have to be interacted with unless you are making a lot of CHIF’s.

#### Is there a limit on the Text I can add?

No. The same principle applies as the file size limit question. The goal is to produce as small a CHIF as possible, so only include the minimum amount of text data required for the use case.

#### Is there a character limit on the alt text?

No, but the goal is to use as little text as possible

#### What do the external Bearer Token do?

Authenticates the user to the Manager API for automation use cases.

#### Where do I find the player script file?

This is hosted in our CDN.

#### What is the stream Files function?

See the player API docs for details.

#### I’ve never touched code ever, is this something I can do on my own if I follow the exact instructions?

For now, the intended audience for integrating CHIF on a web site is someone who is comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A small amount of coding is required in the absence of a fully automated plugin or web creation editor on a managed platform.

#### How do I extract the CHIF file to put it in my websites code? Do I just copy and paste?

Download the CHIF file and upload it to the web site host just like an image.

#### How do I change the size of the CHIF if I want it smaller or larger on my site?

Some sizing can be done using CSS, but the goal would be to handle the target sizing before encoding, since resizing a small image large would cause it to look blurry, and resizing a large image downward would be a waste of bandwidth in most cases.

#### What are the ratios I can put in the CSS? What are the recommended tables I should consider? 400px, 800px, 20px?

This depends on the desired image size and generally outside the scope of CHIF.

#### Can I share this on social media?

Social media web sites will not have the player integrated, so the only way to share is to post a link to your site where the CHIF is hosted and player is integrated.

#### Will this display for everyone, everwhere or might I have issues with certain browsers, or different country codes?

The most popular and modern browsers are supported. Older browsers will likely not work since CHIFs require advanced features of JavaScript, web audio, and streaming.

#### Are there any privacy concerns that I need to think about?

#### Are their any copyright concerns I need to think about?

Since you are hosting the content on your page we recommend you adhere to standard copyright laws but this would not involve C-Hear since it lives on your domain.

#### How do I place a ticket for support?

## ACCESSIBILITY

#### What is WCAG 2.0 & 2.1?

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) established the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 & 2.1; which has set the standard-essential design concepts labeled as Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). Designers and developers are asked to meet all four of these principals to benefit all types of users with disabilities and then select the appropriate degree of compliance (Level A, AA, or AAA conformity). Please follow the current WCAG 2.1 as it was recently published in June 2018.

#### Why are your texts larger than normal on the C-Hear website?

We purposefully have chosen to do this to allow internet users to quickly scan content versus reading word for word. Besides, who wants to reach for reading glasses all the time.

#### I have a non-profit that helps people with disabilities, and I want C-Hear Accessibility to get involved or use C-Hear technology. What do I do, and whom do I contact?

Great! Please feel free to contact us by emailing Dylan Rafaty at Accessibility@C-Hear.com and share the reasons why you want C-Hear Accessibility to get involved.

#### Which type of users will benefit the most when engaging and/or interacting with CHIF?

CHIF is a unique file that will have the ability to reach the widest audience possible. Individuals who are deaf and/or hard of hearing will have the opportunity to read the alt-text of the image or video contained within CHIF. Blind and/or visually impaired users will have the option to either listen to an audio recording and/or have a screen reader (or JAWS) interpret the alt-text of the CHIF file.

#### Are there any audio settings for me to play the CHIF louder and/or softer?

No. Today, CHIF plays at a current audio range at **\_\_\_**.

#### Will I be able to decrease and/or increase the font size of the alt-text within CHIF?

No. Currently, the standard font size in CHIF is **\_\_\_**.

#### What are alt tags and how do they work?

Alt tags are short for alternative tags, alt attributes, and alt descriptions. It refers to an HTML attribute, in which, you would apply it to an image tag, and applying them may increase your search engine optimization ranking. Alt tags provide small but enough information to describe and/or interpret what the image (or CHIF) looks like.

#### Can I translate it into other languages? How about American Sign Language (ASL)? Does it work with those types of translation apps?

No. Currently, we are exploring options to work with accessible and appropriate 3rd party partners to develop this option for our users.

#### I'm sensitive to bright white screens. Do you have the feature for users to select the dark mode option inside the C-Hear CHIF Manager?

Yes, we do have this option and you can find this selected feature at/inside \***\*\_\_\_\*\***.

#### Is the C-Hear Technology keyboard accessible and other assistive technologies like a JAWS screen reader?

Yes. Today, the CHIF is keyboard accessible and adaptable to screen readers like JAWS.
